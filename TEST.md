#### Accessibility Improvements

As part of ensuring better usability and accessibility for all users, Chrome Developer Tools flagged certain improvements related to form elements. While these improvements do not affect the current functionality of the application, they highlight opportunities to enhance accessibility and compliance with best practices.

<details>
<summary>Read more</summary>

#### Suggestions:
1. **Unique `id` Attributes for Form Fields**  
   Chrome DevTools suggested that form fields should have unique `id` attributes. This helps associate `<label>` elements with the corresponding input fields more effectively, which is particularly beneficial for assistive technologies like screen readers.

2. **Labels Associated with Form Fields**  
   It was recommended to associate `<label>` elements with form fields using the `for` attribute and a matching `id`. This improves accessibility by providing clear input field descriptions for users relying on screen readers.

#### Current Implementation:
- The application dynamically renders input fields (e.g., for adding or editing ingredients). Each input field is assigned a unique `id` at runtime using the component's state and logic.
- However, Chrome DevTools occasionally suggests these improvements because dynamic IDs and their association with labels can sometimes appear unclear during rendering.

#### Future Plans:
These accessibility suggestions will be reviewed in future updates to further improve usability and compliance:
- Ensure all dynamically generated input fields have consistently unique `id` values.
- Confirm that all `<label>` elements reference the correct `id` using the `for` attribute.

#### Why Not Addressed Immediately:
- The current implementation does not break functionality or usability.
- Addressing this improvement requires significant changes to the rendering logic for dynamic components, which is not critical at this stage.

By documenting these suggestions, I acknowledge the improvements while focusing on maintaining a functional and efficient user experience.
