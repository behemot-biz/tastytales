 ## Introduction

This section documents the testing process undertaken for the **TastyTales** project, which includes both the frontend (React) and backend (Django REST Framework). Testing was an essential part of ensuring that the application delivers a robust, accessible, and user-friendly experience across devices and platforms.

The testing strategy involved a combination of **manual tests**, **automatic tests**, and **validation checks** to ensure the application meets functional, usability, and coding standards. The tests were conducted on various features such as navigation, recipe management, user interactions (e.g., likes, follows, and comments), and API endpoints.

Key testing components include:

- **Manual Testing**: Simulating user actions on the site to validate the proper functioning of core features, such as navigation, recipe creation, editing, and deletion.
- **Lighthouse Reports**: Evaluating the performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO for both desktop and mobile views.
- **CSS and HTML Validation**: Ensuring the code adheres to web standards for styling and structure.
- **PEP8 Validation**: Verifying Python code compliance with PEP8 standards for readability and maintainability.
- **API Testing**: Assessing the correctness of backend endpoints using Django REST Framework's UI for both authenticated and unauthenticated scenarios.
- **Automated Tests**: Writing unit tests for critical functionality in both frontend and backend components, with coverage reports to confirm testing completeness.

This rigorous testing ensures the **TastyTales** application is reliable, user-friendly, and accessible to a broad audience.

#### Accessibility Improvements

As part of ensuring better usability and accessibility for all users, Chrome Developer Tools flagged certain improvements related to form elements. While these improvements do not affect the current functionality of the application, they highlight opportunities to enhance accessibility and compliance with best practices.

<details>
<summary>Read more</summary>

#### Suggestions:
1. **Unique `id` Attributes for Form Fields**  
   Chrome DevTools suggested that form fields should have unique `id` attributes. This helps associate `<label>` elements with the corresponding input fields more effectively, which is particularly beneficial for assistive technologies like screen readers.

2. **Labels Associated with Form Fields**  
   It was recommended to associate `<label>` elements with form fields using the `for` attribute and a matching `id`. This improves accessibility by providing clear input field descriptions for users relying on screen readers.

#### Current Implementation:
- The application dynamically renders input fields (e.g., for adding or editing ingredients). Each input field is assigned a unique `id` at runtime using the component's state and logic.
- However, Chrome DevTools occasionally suggests these improvements because dynamic IDs and their association with labels can sometimes appear unclear during rendering.

#### Future Plans:
These accessibility suggestions will be reviewed in future updates to further improve usability and compliance:
- Ensure all dynamically generated input fields have consistently unique `id` values.
- Confirm that all `<label>` elements reference the correct `id` using the `for` attribute.

#### Why Not Addressed Immediately:
- The current implementation does not break functionality or usability.
- Addressing this improvement requires significant changes to the rendering logic for dynamic components, which is not critical at this stage.

By documenting these suggestions, I acknowledge the improvements while focusing on maintaining a functional and efficient user experience.

### Manual Testing of API Using Django REST Framework (DRF) UI
Manual testing of the API endpoints was conducted using the Django REST Framework (DRF) UI. This process involves interacting with the API directly through the browser-based interface provided by DRF. Below is a detailed report of the endpoints tested, the results, and observations.


#### Testing Process
1. **Setup**:
   - Launch the Django development server.
   - Open the browser and navigate to the API root endpoint (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`).

2. **Endpoints Tested**:
   - Each endpoint was tested for functionality, including retrieval, creation, updating, and deletion where applicable.
   - Both successful and edge case scenarios were tested.

3. **Authentication**:
   - Used DRF's built-in authentication mechanism to test authenticated and unauthenticated requests.

4. **Data Verification**:
   - Verified database changes using raw database queries after each test.


#### Test Results
The following table lists the endpoints tested along with their results:

| **Endpoint**                  | **Method** | **Description**                         | **Authenticated** | **Expected Outcome** | **Pass/Fail** |
|--------------------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|---------------|
| `/recipes/`                    | `GET`      | Retrieve all recipes                    | No                 | List all recipes      | Pass          |
| `/recipes/`                    | `POST`     | Create a new recipe                     | Yes                | Recipe created        | Pass          |
| `/recipes/<id>/`               | `GET`      | Retrieve a single recipe by ID          | No                 | Recipe details        | Pass          |
| `/recipes/<id>/`               | `PUT`      | Update a recipe (own)                   | Yes                | Recipe updated        | Pass          |
| `/recipes/<id>/`               | `PUT`      | Update a recipe (not own)               | Yes                | 403 Forbidden         | Pass          |
| `/recipes/<id>/`               | `DELETE`   | Delete a recipe (own)                   | Yes                | Recipe deleted        | Pass          |
| `/recipes/<id>/`               | `DELETE`   | Delete a recipe (not own)               | Yes                | 403 Forbidden         | Pass          |
| `/ingredients/`                | `POST`     | Add ingredient to a recipe              | Yes                | Ingredient added      | Pass          |
| `/ingredients/<id>/`           | `DELETE`   | Remove ingredient from a recipe         | Yes                | Ingredient removed    | Pass          |
| `/recipes/?search=<term>`      | `GET`      | Search recipes by ingredient            | No                 | Relevant recipes      | Pass          |

---

- **Authentication:** The endpoints behave as expected for authenticated and unauthenticated requests. Proper `403 Forbidden` errors are returned when unauthorized users attempt restricted actions.
- **Validation:** All inputs are properly validated, and appropriate error messages are returned for invalid data.
